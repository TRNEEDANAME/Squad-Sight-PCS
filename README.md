## Description

This is the GitHub repository of the **mod project** folder for my [Squad Sight PCS mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/2968754968). 
This will be the most up-to-date project folder from the mod, even before it's on Steam.

## How to build the mod

### What you will need

- The Modbuddy SDK (Search in the steam's tool sections)
- Follow the [guide from the Xcom 2 modding subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/xcom2mods/wiki/firsttime#wiki_how_to_install_and_set_up_xcom_2_wotc_sdk)
- Start the SDK, go into the file then "open mod project" (you will need to extract the project's folder).

### Mods used by this mod

#### Required mods

- [X2WOTCCommunityHighlander v1.24.0](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1134256495)

## FAQ

### Why not post the "ready to use" version of the mod ?
It's easier for me, but you can change the config without compiling the mod again.

### Can I do pull requests ?
**YES**, you can, you can open issues, pull requests, discussions...

### Can I fork it ?
As per the MIT Licence, you can. Just credit the original author (me) and Endlesspie49 if you keep the UPK file and/or the mod preview image.
